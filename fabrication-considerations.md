### Actinofibril Materials Fabrication Lattice

Recommended Scalable Path: Aligned Electrospinning + Soft Matrix Infusion

1. Polymer Solution Preparation
   - Stiff core: PCL/PU/silk fibroin + fillers (CNT, CNC, graphene oxide) for modulus contrast
   - Solvent: DMF, HFIP, or aqueous for bio-based

2. Electrospinning & Alignment
   - Voltage: 10–30 kV, flow rate 0.5–2 mL/h
   - Collector: Rotating drum or parallel electrodes → 80–95% fiber alignment (spanwise)
   - Fiber diameter: 100–500 nm (tunable via concentration/voltage)

3. Matrix Infusion & Embedding
   - Soft matrix: Silicone elastomer, TPU, hydrogel (silk fibroin-based)
   - Method: Spin-coating, dip-coating, vacuum infusion → fully encapsulate aligned fibers
   - Cure/cross-link: Thermal, UV, enzymatic

4. Post-Processing
   - Optional plasma treatment → surface energy tuning
   - Multi-layer stacking → mimic multilayer patagium (stiff + soft + stiff)

Alternative Paths:
- Directed Self-Assembly + Templating: AAO/PCTE pores → stiff fiber growth → matrix embed
- 3D/4D Printing: Continuous fiber reinforcement in soft matrix (DIW/DLP)
- Wet-Spinning + Coaxial: Continuous stiff core + soft sheath → bundle winding

Valence Check:
- Bio-based polymers & aqueous baths preferred
- Low-VOC solvents, recyclable collectors
- Passive anisotropic stiffness → eternal mercy in morphing & flight
