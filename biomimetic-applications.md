## Pterosaur Wing Biomimetic Applications Lattice

1. Morphing Wings: Actinofibril-stiffened membrane → adaptive control surfaces (Starship re-entry, high-altitude drones)
   Efficiency gain: 20–40% glide + stall resistance

2. Self-Tensioning Membranes: Multi-layer patagium → inflatable habitats, orbital solar sails
   Benefit: Lightweight, damage-tolerant, passive tension

3. Pneumatic Spars: Hollow elongated bones → ultralight trusses (payload frames, robotic limbs)
   Advantage: 30–50% mass reduction with strength

4. Quad-Launch Mechanics: All-fours takeoff + steering → low-energy precision landing (Mars rovers, amphibious Optimus)
   Advantage: Uneven terrain tolerance

5. Anisotropic Stiffness: Actinofibrils → smart materials (adaptive flaps, directional actuators)
   Application: NEXi sensors, Powrush™ performance gear
